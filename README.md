# Road-Accident-Analysis-Excel

## Project Objective
  
The primary objective of this project is to create a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes road accident data. The dashboard aims to provide insights into the frequency, severity, and characteristics of road accidents, thereby aiding stakeholders in understanding patterns and identifying areas for improvement in road safety measures.

## Dashboard Features

The Road Accident Dashboard is designed with several key features to ensure a detailed and user-friendly presentation of the data:

* Total Casualties
* Casualties by Severity
* Casualties by Vehicle Type
* Monthly Trend Analysis
* CY vs PY Casualties: A line chart comparing casualties in the current year (2022) and the previous year (2021) on a monthly basis.
* Casualties by Road Type
* Casualties by Road Surface
* Casualties by Location/Area
* Casualties by Light Condition


### Filter Panel:

*Accident Date: Users can filter data by different periods (e.g., quarters of 2021 and 2022).
*Location: Users can toggle between rural and urban areas to filter the data accordingly.

## Use Case
The dashboard is intended for use by policymakers, traffic management authorities, urban planners, and road safety organizations. It serves as a tool for:

* Analyzing trends in road accidents
* Identifying high-risk areas and periods
* Developing targeted road safety campaigns and measures
* Allocating resources effectively for accident prevention and response


## Future Enhancements
To enhance the utility of the dashboard, future iterations may include:

* Real-time data updates
* Predictive analytics for forecasting future accident trends
* Detailed demographic analysis of casualties
* Integration with geographic information systems (GIS) for spatial analysis


## Tools Used
